My name is Prabhanjan, and I found this assignment very interesting.
Thank you for the great opportunity — I enjoyed exploring the requirements and implementing all the criteria mentioned in the task.

This project is fully completed as per the assignment guidelines and has been deployed on Netlify for easy access and testing.

✔️ Key Features Implemented
1. Enhanced Search Functionality

Users can search using:

Channel

Region

Combined search (e.g., “facebook us”, “google europe”)

The search supports multiple tokens, and each token can match either a channel or region, offering a highly flexible and intuitive user experience.

2. Filtering & Performance Updates

All dashboard sections (KPIs, charts, performers) update correctly based on filtered data.

Smooth UI updates without unnecessary re-renders.

3. Redux Toolkit Integration

State management is implemented using Redux Toolkit (RTK).

Search & filter values are memoized using Reselect, ensuring optimized performance even with large datasets.

4. Responsive Dashboard Layout

Clean layout with scrollable table section.

Dashboard KPIs, charts, and filters arranged properly for a professional analytical UI.

5. Netlify Deployment

The entire project has been deployed on Netlify, making it accessible for review and testing.
